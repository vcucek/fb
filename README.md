# fb (File Browser)
### Minimalistic file manager/browser written in Bash.

- VIM like keybindings (hjkl - move, o - create file/folder, i - open file, v - mark files, y - copy, p - paste, ...).
- Does not fill up or replace terminal window space (press 'F' to toggle fullscreen). The idea is that fb should supplement the workflow in terminal, without opening additional window or clearing existing terminal content.
- SSH to a remote machine and copy files. Switch between connected hosts with TAB key.
- Bookmarks stored in a text file with file paths and optional descriptions. They can also represent remote SSH locations.
- File selection (used for copying or moving) gets persisted between fb processes.
- Toggle between list view and tree view (use ~)
- Colorized output as in `ls` shell command.
- Sort files and folders based on modification time, name and size.
- File content search with matched line displayed alongside filename.
- Switch current directory on exit by adding alias to .bashrc `alias ff='fb; cd $(fb -d)'`.
- Execute command using marked files/folders as arguments (for example `git -C {} status` prints statuses of marked git folders).
- Confirmation dialogs before executing copy/move/delete operations.
- Use + key to reveal current mode actions and keybindings.
- For other features please look at keybindings listed below.

This project has been inspired by suckless programs and their philosophy. It has been made for fun and to acquire some additional knowledge about shell and its ecosystem.
Contibutions, additional testing or bug reporting is greatly apprechiated.

#### Installation
1. Copy fb script to /usr/local/bin
2. export `EDITOR` and `TERMINAL` environment variables to override defaults (vi, st)
3. Add following alias to .zshrc or .bashrc to be able to cd to a navigated folder:
```
alias ff='fb; if [ $(fb -h) ]; then ssh -t -o "ControlPath ~/.cache/fb/remotes/$(fb -h)" ssh://$(fb -h) "cd $(fb -d);$SHELL"; else cd $(fb -d); fi'

```

#### Requirements
- Linux OS
- Bash version greater then 4.0

#### How to navigate
Use 'j','k' keys to navigate through files and folders or 'C^u','C^d' to move 10 files up or down. Press 'h' or 'Backspace' to move up the filesystem hierarchy. Press `l` or `Return` to enter a folder.
When using the tree view model (press '~' to toggle), use 'l','h' keys to expand or colapse a folder content and 'Return','Backspace' to change the current directory up or down the hierarchy.
Press 'gg' or 'G' to move the cursor to fist or last file in a directory or 'L','M','H' to navigate to top, middle or bottom of the view.
By pressing 'f', followed by a character, you can quickly jump to a first file occurance stating with that character. Press '.' to repeat this action.
When searching for a specific file in the current directory, press '/' to filter the output. For searching files recursively press '?'.  It is also possible to search files based on content by pressing 'g?'.

#### How to Copy, Move files and folders
Use 'v' key to mark desired files and folders or 'V' to mark everything. After that, press 'y' to add them to the selection list. The selection list is used when executing copy or move actions. When files are stored in the selection, the user can close the application and navigate to the destination folder by other means (for exmaple executing 'cd -' in a shell to jump to a previous folder) or use the fb folder navigation commands. When fb is located in the desired destination folder you can copy or move files, stored in the selection, by pressing 'p' or 'm' keys respectively.

#### How to use bookmarks
Bookmarks provide a quick way to navigate to frequently visited locations. Press 'B' to add the current folder to bookmarks. After that you can press 'b' key to view stored bookmarks and 'l' to enter a desired folder. Bookmarks can also include remote SSH folders. You can edit stored bookmarks by pressing 'i', which opens up the VI editor.

#### Remote SSH
Majority of functions supported when browsing local machine are also supported when fb is connected to a remote SSH host.
Remote fb connection can be initiated either by pressing '@' key or opening previously bookmarked remote location. Pressing 'TAB' key switches between local machine and connected remotes.
Fb can also be used to quickly ssh to a remote host folder and perform some shell command by pressing ":".

#### Default programs
By default the program uses xdg-open for opening files, vim for editing files and st (simple terminal) for opening new terminals.
